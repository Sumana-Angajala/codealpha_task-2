# 🤖 Basic Rule-Based Chatbot

A simple **rule-based chatbot** built in Python.
This project demonstrates the use of **if-elif statements, functions, loops, and user input/output** to simulate a conversation between a user and a chatbot.

## ✨ Features

* 🟢 **Basic Greetings** – responds to `hello`, `hi`, `hey`.

* ⏰ **Date & Time** – tells the current date & time.
* 😂 **Jokes** – responds with a random joke.
* 🙏 **Thanks Reply** – replies to `thank you`.
* 👋 **Exit Command** – type `bye` to end the chat.
* 🎨 **Colors & Design** – uses **Colorama** for styled text and boxed chat messages.

Do you want me to also **write a short one-line GitHub project tagline** (like *“A fun Python chatbot with colors, jokes, and time-based greetings”*) for the repo header?
